Here are the answers to the questions from the lab instructions:

1. (a) What do you see in the response when calling the API root endpoint https://api.github.com?
The API root endpoint provides a JSON response that includes a
list of URLs representing available endpoints for the GitHub REST API.
It also contains metadata about the API, such as documentation URL and the current API version.

1. (b) b. Get your Github profile information from the endpoint (replace username with your’s)
https://api.github.com/users/username.

The response contains details such as my username, ID, public repositories count, followers, and more.

1. c. What is the purpose of the various X-Ratelimit- headers that you see in the response?

In the X-Ratelimit-* headers provide information about API usage limits. Here, Key headers include:

X-Ratelimit-Limit: The maximum number of requests allowed within the time window (also given).
X-Ratelimit-Remaining: The number of remaining requests in the current time window.
X-Ratelimit-Reset: The timestamp for when the rate limit resets.

1. d. To access restricted operations via the API, you need to authenticate yourself first.
Explain what effect the following code has at the HTTP protocol level, when a request is
made using that session.

* The Authorization heade sends the token with each request,enabling authentication. 
* It allows access to restricted or user specific API operations that require authentication. 
* All requests made using this session inherit the header,ensuring seamless authentication. 

1. e. Use the session you created to create a repository owned by you by making a POST
request to https://api.github.com/user/repos. Include the following request body, to create
a repo named “test.” (Hint: use the json keyword argument when calling the method
requests.post)

repo was created in GitHub.


2. a.Write a function called github_superstar that does the following

2. b.Write code to watch the repo that wins github_superstars for
https://github.com/cepdnaclk.

lab\Lab3> pipenv run python ex2a.py
GitHub Superstars: [('DeepSelectNet', 18), ('FlowChartGenerator', 12), ('HotelAppleBees-Database-Project', 6), ('e17-3yp-smart-apartment-security-system', 3), ('Matrix-Game', 1), ('Akilax0.github.io', 1), ('AkithaPathirana.github.io', 1), ('24-bit-map-colour-inverter', 1), ('e18-3yp-Corals-Protector', 1), ('directionApp', 1), ('19Kaumini', 0), ('AarahJF', 0), ('app-quz', 0), ('AchinthaSandakalum.github.io', 0), ('Achsu00', 0), ('aces-2022-main-site', 0), ('EDF-LMS', 0), ('AI-STORE-BACK-END', 0), ('akashwi', 0), ('e19-3yp-Project-Smart-Water-Tank', 0), ('amandasiriwardane', 0), ('aces-2022-main-site', 0), ('BootstrapGeneralizationBasic_GR', 0), ('people.ce.pdn.ac.lk', 0), ('AnjanaIllankoon', 0), ('e17-3yp-Healthy-Milk-Collecting-System', 0), ('people.ce.pdn.ac.lk', 0), ('first-git-test', 0)]

2. c. Github has two versions of its API currently available: v3 and v4. How do you inform the
API which version you want to use?

Include the Accept header to specify the desired API version

headers = {'Accept': 'application/vnd.github.v3+json'}
response = requests.get('https://api.github.com', headers=headers)

Use application/vnd.github.v3+json for v3 or application/vnd.github.graphql+json for v4.

d. Explain the difference between the two API versions. Is one “better” than the other?
Why?

v4 is more efficient for complex data requirements, but v3 is simpler and widely supported.
